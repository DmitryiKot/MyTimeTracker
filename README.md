# MyTimeTracker

1. Install requirements
2. Make migrations
3. Run server

Register new user, then logging.
At the top of the page: your first name, logout, profile and edit.
Logout - exit from current profile.
Profile - show all about your profile.
Edit - enables editing profile.

Create - create a high level task. Title of task and finish date(yyyy-mm-dd).
(To find how much time is left before task complete, need add to end of address bar 'timer'.
I could'n figure out how to transfer it to the task without duplication of the task itself during auto-updating)

All task - list of all high level tasks.
Create low level task - create a subtask in a task.
